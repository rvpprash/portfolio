      <p>
        I’m a front-end developer with experience across finance, real estate,
        and e-commerce. I build clean, accessible interfaces using React,
        Next.js, and TypeScript, and I care a lot about performance, usability,
        and design consistency. I’ve worked on everything from real estate
        search platforms to analytics dashboards and shared UI libraries. I
        enjoy solving real problems with code, and I like working closely with
        designers, backend devs, and product teams to ship thoughtful, scalable
        products.
