          Iâ€™m a developer passionate about building fast, accessible web apps
          that scale effortlessly. I have experience building reusable UI
          libraries that combine thoughtful design with clean, efficient code.
          <br />
          <br />
          Currently, I work full-stack, focusing on React, Next.js, and
          TypeScript for frontend experiences, and Nest.js, Prisma, and MongoDB
          for scalable backend APIs. I also have a strong interest in analytics
          and data visualization
